Slide it
=======

Slide it allows for you to slide to a specific slide number in your nivo slideshow. This has not been tested using multiple slideshows on one page. It has been tested in FF12, Chrome 18, and IE9.

Usage
-----

Simply insert a link into your document with the following syntax:

`<a name="slideTo#NUM#" rel="#SLIDE#">`

Replace #NUM# with anything you want, all you need is to make sure the slideTo is in the name.
Replace #SLIDE# with the number of the slide you want to link to. (This is based on the first image in the slideshow being 1).

Demo
